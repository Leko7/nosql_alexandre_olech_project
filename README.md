## NoSQL Project - Alexandre OLECH

Repository for the NoSQL Project on Time Series distance measures.

The `main.py` script computes the average 1NN accuracy over datasets of the UCR archive, for different combinations of time series distance measures and normalizations.
Then, it exports csv and png files corresponding to the reproduction of Table 2 from the "Debunking Four Long-Standing Misconceptions
of Time-Series Distance Measures" article by J. Paparrizos et al.
